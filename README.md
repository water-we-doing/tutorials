# Tutorials for Python, GEE, and GoogleColab

These are basic (and verbose) tutorials with helpful code and background for using Python in and outside of Google Colab.

Made by Erica McCormick, who learned from and got code from many other sources! Last updated August 29, 2022.

Feel free to add to these!

* Make sure Python and Git are installed on your computer
* Clone a GitHub repository onto your computer!

## Intro_to_Colab

* Import packages from a variety of sources - including GitHub
* Import files of all kinds and export them to Drive - including GEE
* Some plotting tricks - like making custom legends
* Links to background reading

## Intro_to_GEE

To sign up for GEE for the first time:
1. Fill out the form (https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/)
2. Email Dr. Rempe or Erica the email account you used to sign up for GEE

To authenticate outside of Colab (ie on the command line), follow these instructions:

* Setting up GEE and Drive
* Background on basic GEE terminology and worldview
* FInding, importing, uploading, and exporting datasetes
* Demo on calculating MAP for Texas with exporting Image

## Intro_to_WaterPyk

* Erica made the WaterPyk package to speed up many common Rempe-lab analyses
* Get any GEE timeseries or Image extracted for a point, watershed, or polygon in *one line of code*!
* Make common plots, perfectly formatted, with *one additional line of code*!
* Demo on the main use case: the StudyArea class
* List of additional functionality.
* **extract_and_process** is an abridged waterpyk tutorial you may use as well

## Intro_to_Watersheds

* Helpful chunks for dealing with USGS watersheds and extracting GEE data with simple plots
* This code is all implemented in WaterPyk and might be outdated here since this tutorial is from 2021!
